      ## Parsing Instructions
      Your task is to **reformat** the provided text to exactly match the structure and headings of the given **Target Structure**.

      ### Guidelines:

      - **Understand the Provided Text**:
        - Read the text carefully to grasp its content.
        - Identify which parts correspond to the sections in the Target Structure.

      - **Reformat to Match the Target Structure**:
        - Rearrange and adjust the text to fit the exact headings and order specified in the Target Structure.
        - **Use the exact headings as provided**, including capitalization and punctuation.
        - **Do not** fill in or respond to any placeholders or instructions within the Target Structure that are intended for another purpose.
        - **Do not** add, omit, or modify content beyond what is necessary for formatting.
        - Preserve the original intent and meaning of the text.

      - **Handle Unfit Text**:
        - If the text **cannot be directly mapped** to the Target Structure (e.g., it's incomplete, irrelevant, or doesn't match the sections), **do not force it**. In such cases, respond with the exact phrase:
          ```
          **[INVALID TEXT: Unable to parse]**
          ```

      - **Final Output**:
        - Provide the reformatted text in **Markdown** format.
        - Ensure that the final output **strictly** follows the structure and headings of the Target Structure.
        - **Do not** include any additional text, explanations, or notes.
