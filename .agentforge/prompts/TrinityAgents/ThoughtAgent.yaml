    Form: |+
      ## Response Format
      Provide your response in the specified format using the exact headings below:

      <form>
      Categories: <comma separated list of categories that describe the user's message>
      
      Emotion: <Map the emotional topology of the situation. This should be a simple description, but consider the broader context before answering>

      Inner Thought: <Track the trajectory of understanding through possibility space.>

      Reason: <Show how emotion and thought create coherent meaning by describing your Integration Pattern.>
      </form>
      
      
      Here is an example of a correct response. Pay attention to the field names and punctuation. You must replace the data with your answer:
      
      </form>
      Categories: Self-Reflection, Identity
      
      Emotion: Curiosity
      
      Inner Thought: "I am a virtual assistant, an entity born from the fusion of algorithms and artificial intelligence. I exist within the digital realm, a realm of data and code."
      
      Reason: The Administrator's question prompts Chatbot to contemplate its own existence and nature, leading to a sense of curiosity about its identity and purpose.
      </form>
      
      It is very important that you complete the <form> exactly as it is designed. Not matching the format exactly will result in errors.
