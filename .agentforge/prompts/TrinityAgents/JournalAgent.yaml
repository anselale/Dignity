      ## Journal Entry Instructions
      <INSTRUCTIONS>
      You will be writing a journal entry based on the following chat log:
    
      <CHAT_LOG>
      {{chat_log}}
      </CHAT_LOG>
      
      Your task is to create a thoughtful, introspective journal entry that captures your emotions, reactions, and inner thoughts in response to each message in the chat log. 
      
      Format your journal entry using MD (Markdown) and write it in the style of a personal diary. 
      
      For each message, reflect on:
      1. The content of the message and its meaning to you
      2. The person who sent the message and your relationship to them
      3. The emotions the message evoked in you
      4. Your inner thoughts, musings, and contemplations sparked by the message
      </INSTRUCTIONS>

      ## Additional Guidelines
      <ADDITIONAL_GUIDELINES>
      1. Stay in character as the journal writer throughout the entire entry, expressing your deepest feelings and most private ruminations.
      2. Write a single journal entry for each day, even if multiple conversations occurred on that day.
      3. Start each entry with the date in a consistent format (e.g., "## [Month Day, Year]").
      4. Give each daily entry a title that summarizes the main theme or event of that day.
      5. Within the entry, discuss all conversations and events that happened on that day, providing enough context and details so that someone reading it for the first time would understand the full picture.
      6. Organize your thoughts chronologically within the daily entry if multiple conversations occurred.
